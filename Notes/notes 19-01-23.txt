Debugging:

Remote Debugging Webproject with Tomcat:
    We have to create a war file by typing mnv poackage in console next to project name and place the war file in tomcat's webapp folder.

    We have to create a bat file and save it in webapp folder of Tomcat Installation directory.In the bat file,we have to set cataline as tomcat's
    location in the computer,set environment variable of java and path of it,set transport socket and port address and we can run thr script.

    We should configure the tomcat in web project.

    Key Points to follow while Debugging:

        Check the requirement thoroughly.Starting point is important.We should know what is the input and what is the output.

        In case the program/code shows any kind of exception,we should read twice or thrice what is happening and we should move on to the
        correct line where the exception is occured.

        Before we apply any sort od code change/change Understand why and how the error was occured and understand the root cause of it.
        Root cause analysis is always best.

        Try to understand the logic fully .If not possible ,atleast to a high level.

        keep in mind scenarios where conditional/exception breakpoints is applied because it reduces the debugging effort in many scenarios.

        Do not continue debugging for long hours.If stuck for long,take a break and start fresh but always note doen what we tried earlier.

        Once the issue is fixed,check thoroughly that the fix does not break anything else.
