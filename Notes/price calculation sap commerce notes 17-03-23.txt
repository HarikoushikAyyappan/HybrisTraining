Price Calculation:
 Filtering Price Rows:
   During Filtering Process,europe1 priceFactory selects all the PriceRows matching the combination of customer and product.

   A priceRow must match all of the following criteria to apply,

   customer or customer group or no customer-related value (blank field)
   product or product group or no product-related value (blank field)
   date range
   scale price

   If any one of the above criteria fails,then europe1 priceFactory will not consider it.

   Customer matching:
    To match the customer,PriceRow must be one of the following
     1.empty
     2.set to match the customer or customer user group

     The following table lists all the possibilities on whether the pricerow is applied to the customer.

   Product Matching:
   To match a product, a PriceRow must be one of the following:

  1. empty
  2. set to match the product or the product's price group.

  PriceRow Assigned To                Current Product                               PriceRow Applies to the Current Product?

  Scale Prices:
    A PriceRow object can define a scale price through minqtd attribute.
    Generally if the scale price quantity increases the the price per quantity decreases.

    Scale Price Quantity                      Price per Unit
      1                                          100 €
      2                                           95 €
  Net/Gross Prices:
    For each priceRow we can define whether it is net price or gross price.
    Net Price is the pure price of the product and does not include any taxes whereas gross price is the price which is the effective price
     for customer  after deduction of taxes.
    PriceRows has an attribute called net which is used to define whether the value is given in net format or gross format.
    We can use isNet() and setNet(Boolean net) methods to retrieve and specify prices's net or gross status.

    Currency Conversion:
     A priceRow is always epecified in a certain currency. If the currency specifies in pricerow is different from the customer;s
     session,sap automatically converts based on the conversion rates.

     Price Value in PriceRow   Session Currency   Conversion Rate    Effective Price
     10 USD                     USD                1:1                10 USD
     10 USD                     GBP                1.3:1              7.70 GBP

     Using unitFactor:
     The unitfactor attribute specified with priceRow object is used to create scale price with units.
     The applications of the unitfactor is,
        we can scale small prices by a manaegable factor.
        we can base the price on the lot size that we receive the goods in.

        In order to configure the number of digits at the base price, use the following property:

        #scale of the BigDecimal value to be returned. Used during a conversion of Number value to the SQL BigDecimal.
        jdbcmappings.big_decimal_scale=5


        Sorting PriceRows and Selecting a Final Price:
          After the europe1 price factory gathers all the possible pricerows that might apply,those price rows are sorted by customer
          and product matches.
          The customer match has high priority than product match and matching individual settings ranks higher than group settings.
          The priorities are in the following order:
         1. P + C
         2. PG + C
         3. P + CG
         4. PG + CG
         5. P + C*
         6. PG + C*
         7. P* + C
         8. P* + CG
         9. P* + C*

         P -Product matches exactly
         C -Customer matches exactly
         PG  - Productgroup matches exactly
         CG  -Customergroup matches exactly
         P*  -Price matches for all products
         C* -Price matches for all customers

        Enabling Legacy Query Strategy
        Use the following property with the true value to enable the legacy query strategy for fetching user group and product ID
         prices parameters in DefaultPDTRowsQueryBuilder:
         europe1.use.legacy.productid.query.strategy=
         The default value is false.
  Tax Calculation:
    Sap commerce stores all the possible taxes for customers and products as tax row objects.
    Every TaxRow Object represents a certain taxrow constellation which is optionally related to date range,customer,product,customer group
    or product group.
    Every TaxRow object is a potential tax.
    Unlike prices,which can be applied one at a time,taxes and discounts accumulate.
    If an order entry is eligible for more than one tax then all the taxes will be taken into effect.
    eg.If a customer is assigned an individual tax rate of 20% and a product has tax of 20%,so both taxes will get accumulated for the
     particular order entry.
     When a tax is required, the Europe1 PriceFactory retrieves all TaxRow objects related to the combination of customer and products

     Attributes of a TaxRow:
