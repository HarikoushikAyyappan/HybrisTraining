Basics of Data Modelling:

    items.xml file plays a main role in data modelling.

    items.xml file will be present in an extension's resources directory.

    items.xml file is defined as per the structure of items.xml file.

    items.xml file names are prefixed with respective extension name.

    In core extension, it is available as core-items.xml file where all Core itemtypes like Order,Product,Employee,Cus
    tomer and User are defined.

    In trainingcore extension, it is available as trainingcore-items.xml file.

    Items.xml file is always validated against items.xsd.Hence we have to maintain the above order of elements in items.xml file.
    If we do not maintain the above order in items.xml file, build will be failed.

    we can define new item type in items.xml file using code ,deployment and all the attributes for that item type.

    Items.xml file is evaluated in one pass unlike impex which is multi pass processed.Because of single pass,we need
    to specify the item types in the order of inheritance.

    More abstract types has to be defined at the beginning of the items.xml file

    More concrete types has to be defined at the end of the items.xml file
