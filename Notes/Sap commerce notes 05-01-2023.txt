Extensions
    Architecture of SAP Commerce is modular .

    New business logic is developed in separate, function-specific modules called extensions.

    An extension is an encapsulated piece of SAP Commerce functionality,

    An Extension  can contain business logic, type definitions, a web application, and back-office configuration functionality.

    Depending on your business needs, your solution will have a varying number of extensions.

    The created extensions will be  wired into the core SAP Commerce platform via the Spring dependency injection model.

    SAP Commerce has a  number of extension templates,

    There is an ant-based tool (called extgen) for generating new extensions based on these templates.
