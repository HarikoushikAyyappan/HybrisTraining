Application Orchestrator:
*Backoffice custom orchestrator is a tool to configure our application directly with the user interface without changing the code.
*It is used to design the widgets depending on business requirement od consumer,configure widget settings,restrict the visibility of a widget to user depending on the login role
 they have etc.
 Application Custom Backoffice Extension:
 *Backoffcie framework and Administration cockpit with standard backoffice modules.It is a single web application to all backoffice modules.
 *Contains Application Orchestrator by clicking F4(Fn+F4 in Mac).
 *Default URL is https://localhost:9002/backoffice.
 ybackoffice extension template:
 *Template we can use to generate custom extension where we can implement our own backoffice module,widgets or UI design.
 *Application Orchestrator helps in adding configuration .
 *Each extension based on ybackoffice will contribute to the main backoffice application.
 
 Configure BackOffice:
 *Backoffice configuration files contain two files namely backoffice-widgets.xml and backoffice-config.xml.
 *config.xml file contains information about the ui behaviour of the widgets and widgets.xml files contains  the application mashup for any perspective.
 *These two files are meerged and kept in memory mashup for the whole application functioning span.
 *These files can be updated using Application Orchestrator.
 
 Data Modelling:
  Introduction of Type System:
   *We need the efficient exchange of data between application layer ie.) Java objects and Persistence layer ie.)Database. The entities help for the purpose.
     The Structure of  Entities will be defined in items.xml file. 
   *Every Extension starting from the core extension will be related to the extension by properties or relationships.Every Extension will have its items.xml file and the apache ant 
   combines all to form a items.xml file
   *The Entities which are java class objects are generated by the apache ant from the combined items.xml file.The Database tables will store the entity data created or modified 
   using Initialization or system update.
   *The benefit of sap commerce is that it contains query cache and Item cache so that there is no burden on database table.
   *We can check on the item types defined by opening the Bac office and navigating on to items option.
