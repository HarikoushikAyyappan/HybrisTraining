 with other api,billing details and modes etc
*The two types of accelarators are b2c accelaratorsand b2b accelarators.

 different categories,select a product based on different paramters(eg.selecting shoe/shirt size ),features related to billing,cart details,Shipping details etc .

 organization management etc.

SAP COMMERCE Cloud System Architecture:
* The bottom most layer is the database layer(eg.MySql) .The layer above the database layer is the application server(eg.Tomcat).The layer above application server is the platform which has 
 persistence framework and is capable to do business,system and infrastructure services.The layer above is the extensions built on top of platform which can perform functions related to cart,promotion,workflow,
 customer support,pricing etc.The layer above is the Api layer which is used by other entities to get access to the data and services underlying.The top layer is the Frontend layer 
 which has client front end and back office front end applications.The client front end application uses spring mvc based accelarators or spartacus based single application page, the same can alos be 
 accessed by mobile app or any other application that uses RestAPi. The Backoffice Front end consists of features needed for managers,admin depending on the requirement.In addition 
to that it has smartedit feature to customize product/content ie.) accelarator storefront.

Configuration and Installation:
*The SAP COMMERCE has a build framework based on Apache Ant.Apache Ant handles source code generations,compilation and number of automation tasks.
*SAP COMMERCE can be built in two ways 1)Platform wide and 2)Extension specific. If platform-wide is used,the platform and all extensions listed or referenced in localextensions.xml file is built.
if Extension specific is used , only the current extension is bulit even if other extensions are connected by dependencies.Every extension has the Antbuild.xml file after it is initially
created.but generally the one in the platform extension to build the entire suite.
*When Ant is called,the build framework 
          *Generates and compiles Model classes based on the definitions in items.xml file and in the order required by extension dependencies.
          *Collects localization property files(location XY.properties).
          *Updates configuration of the commerce server.
          *Generates new folders in the installation base folder(only during first run).
*ANt build framework  is configured by a number of predefined BuildTargets such as 
          *all-builds the platform and configures the server
          *clean-cleans all the platform and extensions(generated .class files).
          *modulegen-generates a bundled set of interconnected extensions based on a module template.
          *extgen-generates an individual extension based on extension template.
          *initialize-initializes the system(recreates and populates database tables.)	
          *-p-shows the list of Ant targets
