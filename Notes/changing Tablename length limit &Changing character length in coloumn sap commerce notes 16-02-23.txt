Changing Table name Length Limit in Hybris:



1. The maximum length for a deployment table name in Hybris is 24 characters.
2. This is defined in hybris/bin/platform/resources/advanced.properties:
deployment.tablename.maxlength=24

3. We can override the default value by specifying our own value in config/local.properties:
deployment.tablename.maxlength=30

4.We must be  sure to check the database server which may have its own limitations. For example, older versions of Oracle limi
t the table name length to 30 characters.


Changing character limit length of a coloumn:

The length limit of characters in a particular coloumn is 255.

If we want to add more characters we have to code in items.xml file like,

<persistence>
<coloumntype>
  <value> varchar(500)</value>
  </coloumntype>
  </persistence>
