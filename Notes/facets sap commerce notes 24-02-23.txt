Facets:

 Facet Search also referred as Faceted search or faceted filtering is a navigation technique for accessing a collection of available
 information by narrowing down long list of objects to a manageable size.

 Facets are build from with a logic based on search results (based on category).

 On left side , filters like gender , size , Prices , these are called as Facets

 We need to include solrfacetsearch and solrserver extension in localextenions.xml

 Likewise hybris comes up pluggedin with tomcat server.In the similar way , hybris comes with inbuild plugged in Solrserver
  (present in solrserver extension)
 If we have multiple filters inside a facet than that facet is called as Multi value facets (generally checkboxes).
  Single value facets are generally links.

 We have options of Sorting. This is also configured in Solr.

 Pagination can also be  configured in Solr.

 There are two things that we can customize inside solrserver extension,

Stopwords : slang language. We can specify words for which we do not need search results.Eg. Amazon website will have Flipkart as stopword.

Synonym : We can provide same search result for two different things.for eg : someone searching for Pants & if  someone search for
 trousers which are actually same thing.

 Example:

 Requirement: We have to do solr search based on Good quality product,Bad quality product and worst quality product.

 In this case ,we are creating a new attribute say ProductHealthCondition in ootb itemType ApparelProduct.We add values to the attribute using
 impex.

 Then We have to create impex for SolrIndexed Property and SolrSearchQueryProperty.

 A product could be searched through various parameters namely id,name etc. we have to index the product such that it could be searched using
 many paramaters.We will be providing those details in SolrIndexedProperty.

 And we have to mention where a keyword should be searched when a user enters that keyword.ie) when a user enters a keyword,we can specify which are
 the attributes the keyword has to searched in order to match.Eg.If Jeans keyword is searched,it can be searched in catalogId,catagoryName.
 manufacturerName,productName etc. These has to be mentioned in SolrSearchQueryProperty.

 SolrIndexedProperty and SolrSearchQueryProperty are found in solr.impex.

 While Indexing if we give fullIndex option,solr core works in two phases.It creates a backup of existing data in one core. After Indexing,
  it swaps the data.WHile Full indexing,the entire document is deleted and created again.It takes mre time.

  While Update indexing,the thing which is modified is updated.It can be done frequently as it takes less time.

  Indexing can be done using Backoffice and Cronjobs .We can also schedule indexing in Cronjobs.

  In backoffice,when we enter into SolrFacetConfiguration.We will get options to see the indexed properties in Indexed properties tab
  and we can select whether to use full,update or delete and we can start the indexing and we have options to give synonyms in backoffice.

Field Value Provider:

 Field Value Provider is used to provide a complex logic based on which it provides a value.

 Eg.If we want to display a particular product is available for a time period ,we can use Value Provider to do so.

 Requirement:
 Display the number of days product will be available online from current date in the product search box and search result.

 We have an attribute called offlineDate defined inside the Product model already which specifies when the product will go offline
 from the site

 So for this we need to write some logic like offlineDate – currentDate and get this data when we search the product.

 But this data is not available in DB directly, we need to write a custom logic to get this data and then we can send it to Solr for indexing.
 So for this, we need to write ValueProvider.

The steps to do valueProvider is,

1.We need to create a new class for Value provider with the logic for displaying the thing we need to do.

2.We must make the  value provider class as a spring bean

3.Add new attribute onlineDays inside solr.impex file as indexed property  Also specify the value provider
  for the same as below
  \hybris\bin\ext-data\apparelstore\resources\apparelstore\import\coredata\stores\apparel-uk\solr.impex

 Here we have specified the indexed property name as onlineDays and the value provider as productOnlineDaysValueProvider
 So this value provider productOnlineDaysValueProvider should be same as spring bean id of the value provider defined in the
 trainingcore-spring.xml file.

 4.Add new attribute onlineDays inside ProductData.We need to add below line in ProductData bean definitions
    hybris\bin\custom\training\trainingfacades\resources\trainingfacades-beans.xml

   Do ant all to get this attribute generated in the ProductData class

 5.Populate new attribute from solr result to ProductData
   Create a new class by extending SearchResultProductPopulator and Override the populate() method to set this new attribute
   in the ProductData

  We need to add below lines
   //Adding online days to product data
   target.setOnlineDays(this.<Integer> getValue(source, "onlineDays").intValue());


   getValue() method takes 2 parameters
   1)SearchResultValueData : Search result obtained from Solr
   2)String: property name specified in solr.impex file

6.Define the above populator as a spring bean and link it to the existing populator using alias.

  Add bean definition in trainingfacades-spring.xml as below

  hybris\bin\custom\training\trainingfacades\resources\trainingfacades-spring.xml

7.Modify the autocomplete.js file to include this new value as part of search box suggestion result.
  hybris\bin\custom\training\trainingstorefront\web\webroot\_ui\desktop\common\js\acc.autocomplete.js

  renderHtml +=   "<span class='title'>" + "Online Days " +item.onlineDays +"</span>";
  Add above line just below the line renderHtml +=”“;
  onlineDays:obj.onlineDays
  Add above line just below the line
  image: (obj.images!=null && self.options.displayProductImages) ? obj.images[0].url : null


8.  Import solr.impex file
  Import the solr.impex file either manually through HAC or update the system to get it imported automatically

9.Update products with online and offline dates in HMC

10.Perform full indexing through HMC by selecting apparel-uk solr config.
