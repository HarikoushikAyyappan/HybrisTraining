Impex:
 Impex stands for IMPort and EXport .

 We can do impex operations in Hac.

 Import operation is done to import data into the table.Either we can import new data or update data.

 The Features available in ImpEx are Header,ValueLines,macros and comments.

 Eg.Insert_update Employee; uid[unique=true,allownull=$val];name;description[allownull=true];password;sessionLanguage(isocode);groups(uid)[mode=apend]

    ;00092; Test;My First Impex Import Learning Test;hybris1;en;admingroup,employeegroup

    Here First line is the Header and Second line is Value line. The lines in bracket are accessmodifiers.

    sessionLanguage and groups are objects.en is the value of language table and isocode is its coloumn name.

    we have given mode=append inside bracket in groups coloumn definition.It means we can add more values in that particular coloumn.

    Attributes in the definition are uid,name,password,sessionLanguage,groups. The Attributes are semicolon separated if comma is there the
    particular coloumn has more values.

    macros -say if we have to use the modifier allownull=true for many times we can set that as $myVal=true and use as allowNull=$myVal



 The Modes available in ImpEx are Insert,Update ,Remove and Insert_update.

  Insert-It is used to create a new entry if suppose an entry is already present,it gives error.
  Update-It is used to update an entry.If suppose the entry is not there it gives error.
  Remove-It is used to remove an entry.
  Insert_update-It is used to insert an entry if suppose the entry is present it updates and if the entry is not present it creates an new entry.

 Type:
 Eg.select * from {Employee} where {uid}='0052'
   Employee is the Type.

 We will be writing these queries inside ImportContent tab.Right to that we have ImportScript tab using which we can import csv file of bulk
 data into the table.


 Generally there are two types of tables available

   CatalogAware -Table which has Catalogversions namely Staged and Online. Using Catalogs,we can able to do runtime changes in storefront
    Changes are made in Staged version,Then someone reviews it and finally if sychronization is done and the version is changed to Online version.
    It is also possible to make changes in online version also but making changes in staged version reduces errors.Eg.Product

   CatalogUnAware-These Tables does not have catalogversions.Eg.Employee.

   ImpEx for CatalogAware version:


$productCatalog=apparelProductCatalog
$productCatalogName= Apparel Product catalog
$catalogVersion=catalogversion(catalog(id[default=$productCatalog]),version[default='Staged'])[unique=true,default=$productCatalog:Staged]

$baseProduct=baseProduct(code,catalogVersion(catalog(id[default='$productCatalog']),version[default='Staged']))

$approved=approvalstatus(code)[default='approved']




INSERT_UPDATE ApparelProduct;code[unique=true];$catalogVersion;unit(code);supercategories(code,$catalogVersion);varianttype(code);$approved;ean;genders(code)
;32009;;pieces;Clothes,Pow;;;31313;MALE


 Using map in impex file:

INSERT_UPDATE

TestData;sampleName[unique=true];address(key(code),value(code))[map-delimeter=\];
;Danieal;Address Line 1 -> 1230 Larimeter St | Address Line 2 -> Denver | Address Line 3 -> DADA | Address Line 4 ->Unites States;




inser_update Product; pk[unique=true];code
"#% impex.exportItemsFlexibleSearch("" select {p.pk},{p.code} from {Product as p}"");"

Export:

If we want to export data,we must get into backoffice and searching for "script",comes script Generator.

Click Migration option in dropdown menu and the script will be produced to export all the tables in tha database.

We need to just copy the required table and we should paste in the Export content tab in ImpEx Export menu.

AFter Some time ,a zip file is downloaded with the table that we exported.Once unzipped,there contains an  Excel file and importscript.impex
file.

If we want to import the data in another database we have to go ImpEx Import and clicking Importscript and we should select importscript.impex
file by searching the desktop.


BatchMode Operation:
 If we want to update or remove bulk data from/into the table,we use BatchMode Operation.

 Requirement :

 a. I need to update the name Field of all Order with the value 'hybrisTest' in one go.



 INSERT_UPDATE Order;code[Unique=true];name
 ;00000001;hybrisTubeNameTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder4;hybrisTubeNameTest

 ;acceptanceTestOrder1;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder2;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder3;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder4;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder5;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder6;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder7;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder8;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder9;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder0;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder10;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder11;hybrisTest
 ;acceptanceTestOrder12;hybrisTest
 ;zohan-00-1;hybrisTest
 ;zohan-00-2;hybrisTest
 ;00000001;hybrisTest
 ;00000003;hybrisTest
 ;00000005;hybrisTest
 ;00000007;hybrisTest
 ;00000009;hybrisTest
 ;00000011;hybrisTest
 ;00001001;hybrisTest
 ;00001003;hybrisTest
 ;00002002;hybrisTest
 ;00004004;hybrisTest
 ;00004005;hybrisTest
 ;00014000;hybrisTest
 ;00014002;hybrisTest
 ;00014004;hybrisTest


 Batch Mode Operation :

 ------------------------
 Impex to Update all Records of Order Table with name field value as : hybrisTest

 UPDATE Order[batchmode=true];itemtype(code)[unique=true];name
 ;Order;hybrisTest

 -------------------------
 Impex to Update the name field value as 'hybrisSelectiveUpdate' Only for those records in Order Table which have description value as 'aman'

 UPDATE Order[batchmode=true];description[unique=true];name
 ;aman;hybrisSelectiveUpdate


 -----------------------------

 b. I need to remove the all data present in type hybriProductStoreDetails in one go.


 Conventional Way:

 REMOVE hybrisProductStoreDetails;pk[Unique=true]
 ;8796093065189
 ;8796093097957

 Using batchMode Operation

 REMOVE hybrisProductStoreDetails[ batchmode=true];itemtype (code)[unique=true]
 ;hybrisProductStoreDetails

 Batch Mode Operation for consitional based removing :

 REMOVE Order[ batchmode=true];description[unique=true]
 ;aman



 I want to update the name value as "hybrisBatchSelectiveUpdate" for the Order which have description value as "aman"

 00000005



 Document Id in Impex:

 Between User and Address, there is one to Many relations with address relation is defined as part of and qualifier of Address is ‘addresses’.

 In User itemtype, we have 2 attributes : defaultPaymentAddress and defaultShipmentAddress. These attributes are of type Address with
 isSelectionOf as ‘Addresses’.

 Note:  Attribute : isSelectionOf
 References an attribute of the same type. Only values of the referenced attribute can be selected as values for this
  attribute. Typical example: the default delivery address of a customer must be one of the addresses set for the
  customer. Default is 'false'.

 Please Note that partof items do not always provide a unique key but hold their enclosing parent as foreign key.

 For Example : User (Customer) can have different address : defaultPaymentAddress and defaultShipmentAddress.

 Customer owns address exclusively.the address hold the customer pk as back reference.


 When using Impex , both customer and address have to be imported in separate lines.


 You must therefore reference the address using a unique key, which addresses do not provide.

 For  cases where a reference within the impex script is required , Impex provides a special header attribute marked with the prefix & to specify a virtual id called as document id . Each imported line can optionally define such a document id which allows other lines to reference it later using the same attribute qualifier (with & prefix).



 	INSERT_UPDATE Address;&add;owner(Customer.uid)[Unique=true];streetname;postalcode
 	;hybris ;testuser2@test.com;street12;11865

        ;hybris1;testuser2@test.com;street19;11861



 	Update Customer;uid[Unique=true];defaultShipmentAddress(&add)
 	;testuser2@test.com;hybris1
