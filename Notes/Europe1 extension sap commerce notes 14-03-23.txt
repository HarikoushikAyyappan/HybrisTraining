Pricing:
 Europe1 Extension:
   Europe1 Extension is the pricing system of sap commerce and is the default price factory.
   Along with storing and retrieving process information it also does process related to tax,discounts and helps arriving final price.
   In the complete business lifecycle,we will be doing lot of pricing strategies to encourage the customer to buy products.
   Using Europe1 Extension,we can frame our own strategy in pricing and faciliate processin managing the orders.

   The following functions can be done using Europe1 Extension:
    We can store ,retrieve and match prices,tax,discounts to products and customers.
    It provides functionalities related to prices,tax and discounts more flexibly such as,

     per line item-the base price is provided along with taxes and discounts even multiple taxes/discounts.
     per order-global discounts are also  possible(even multiple ones) for the order subtotal.
     Multiple units-products can be sold in different packaging units .eg. 10 packs of glasses with 10 glass in each pack,10 glasses.
     Scale Prices-we may wish to reduce the price of a particular product say glass if it is ordered in bulk quantity beyong a threshold value.
     Date ranges: we may wish to offer any discount on a paricular time period or on a particular day.
     Grouping a customer/product-we may wish to provide discount a customer with whom we may have negotiated so when the particular customer is
       logged in the price will show the discounted price.And we can create price categories and show discounted price for the products
       belonging to the particular category instead of adding discounted prices to individual products.
     Net/Gross prices-We can store  net/gross prices separately but if only either of rate is available we can convert the prices on the fly
        if the order requires so.


    The Europe1 Price factory makes only the pricing part of ordering process. But the Ordering process is part of sap commerce's core
    and it is not integrated with Europe1 Price Factory. Within Ordering Process,Europe1 Price factory matches the Prices,tax and discounts.

    The sap commerce extension may provide some functionality that is licensed by different sap commerce modules.so we must confirm with the
    functionalities specified in contract license and stick on to that.In case of doubt we have to contact sales representative.


Price, Tax, and Discount Calculation:
  Sap commerce stores all possible prices of products as price objects. These price objects represents a certain price constellation which is optionally
  related to date range,customer,products,a group of customer or a group of products.
  Every PriceRow object is a potential price.When a price is required for an order,the Europe1 Price Factory retrieves all the price objects
   related to the combination of customers and products because unless an order is placed ,number of products is not determined and
   the scale prices may apply.
  Whenever an order is placed ,the Europe1 Price Factory retrieves all the price objects related to the customers and products and chooses
  the best matching priceRow.
  To handle a request for the price of a product,the Europe1 PriceFactory retrieves all the priceRow Objects related to customer and products
  The remaining subset of priceRows are converted so that they are comparable.The converted priceRows are sorted by relevance to the
   customer and products.The bast matching combination is taken as result and returned as final price.
