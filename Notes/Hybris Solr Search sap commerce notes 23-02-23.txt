Hybris solr search & solr indexing

Search and Navigation Module supports efficient search and Navigation by providing the solrfacetsearch and solrserver extensions.

Solr Search :
Solr stands for Searching On Lucene w/Replication.It’s (Solr Server) main functionalities are indexing and searching.

Solr is an open source REST-API based Enterprise Real time search and Analytics Engine server from Apache Software Foundation.

It’s core functionality is built using the Apache Lucene (another search engine) Framework and added with some extra and useful features

It is written in java language.

Hybris commerce work with Relational db as its persistence layer , however for search and Navigation on Products , solr is used.

 This requires a regular export of Product data from the Hybris commerce System to Solr. This Process is known as Solr Indexing.

Apache Solr uses Apache Lucene Inverted Index technique (like word to pages instead of pages to words) to index it’s documents.That’s why solr provide very searching feature.

Solr can be used in 2 flavours :
Standalone Apache Solr Server
Cloud and distributed Apache Solr Server


Core definition from Solr dashboard

Documents (corresponding to row in table)
Fields (corresponding to Column in db)
Information in Solr is saved in documents instead of tables (in db technology , a document corresponds to table row and field corresponds to table column).
In Apache Solr , a Document is a group of fields and their values.Documents are the basic unit of data we store in Apache Cores.
One core can contain one or more documents. A field is actual data stored in document (key value pair)

Usage of Solr in hybris:

When User interacts with storefront, non indexed data can be obtained directly from database.

Indexed data is obtained from solr.

Solr gets data for indexing using Query from database and user can access data .

Creating Solr COnfiguration:

$serverConfigName=apparel-ukSolrServerConfig
$indexConfigName=apparel-ukSolrIndexConfig
$searchConfigName=apparel-ukPageSize

#create the Solr Server configuration


INSERT_UPDATE SolrServerConfig;name[Unique=true];mode(code)
;$serverConfigName;standalone

INSERT_UPDATE SolrEndPointUrl;solrServerConfig(name)[Unique=true]
;$serverConfigName;http://localhost:8983/solr;true


There are 3 type of Solr Indexing stretgies :

Full Indexing b. Update Indexing c. Delete Indexing


Full Indexing : All the existing Indexed documents will be deleted first and than fresh indexing will be done from scratch.It takes considerable amount of time, so not advised frequently.
Full indexing supports 2 modes of commit :
Direct Mode -> Will add or update every document in the index and if the operation fails ,previous entry that had been committed will remain available.
Two Phase mode – In this mode , Solr creates one extra core as a temporary core only for indexing,once indexing is successful than it will be swapped with original core.So original core will be safe in case of failure in indexing.
It is called as 2 phase mode mainly because it has 2 solr core involved while indexing.


Update Indexing : only those documents which have been modified within some given time will be indexed and other indexed documents remain as it is.This operation can be done frequently if needed as it consumes less time compared to full indexing stretgy.
Delete Indexing : Used to completely remove the indexed documents.This should be done periodically to maintain the consistency of indexed data as we might have unwanted indexed data in solr from a long time
Any Item type can be indexed using HMC/BACKOFFICE or via Impex.

Indexing for Product item type is already done by Hybris out of the box.
So , if we add new attributes to the Product attribute type and we want those new attributes to be indexed then we need to add those new attributes in the solr impex file.

Cronjobs for full,update,delete indexing.
